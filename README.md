Group Case Studies

These are the case studies that my classmates and I put together in our upper division college course (Math 189) at Univeristy of California, San Diego. The course focused on exploratory data analysis and inference, as we applied formal statistical methods on real life applications. 

1. In our first case study, we took a look at a dataset of mothers who smoked throughout their pregnancy and aimed to seek a correlation between smoking during pregnancy, and the birthweight of the infant. 

2. Our second case study was focused on a subject less worldly, as we applied interval testing and different types of estimation to gather what information we could on the behavioral habits of video-game players. 

3. The course progressed in a more advanced direction as we began to look at more complex data, as we analyzed patterns in DNA to search for the origin of replication in the human cytomegalovirus disease. 

4. Lastly, we were given measurements of polyethylene from a calibration run of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Serviceâ€™s snow gauge and were instructed to provide a simple procedure to convert the snow gain into density.
